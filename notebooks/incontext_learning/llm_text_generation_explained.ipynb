In other words, as humans, we want generated text to surprise us and not to be boring/predictable.

        "\n",
        "[Fan et. al (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04833.pdf) introduced a simple, but very powerful sampling scheme, called ***Top-K*** sampling. In *Top-K* sampling, the *K* most likely next words are filtered and the probability mass is redistributed among only those *K* next words. \n",
        "GPT2 adopted this sampling scheme, which was one of the reasons for its success in story generation. \n",
        "\n",
        "We extend the range of words used for both sampling steps in the example above from 3 words to 10 words to better illustrate *Top-K* sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "![top_k_sampling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/top_k_sampling.png){width=\"50%\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "Having set $K = 6$, in both sampling steps we limit our sampling pool to 6 words. While the 6 most likely words, defined as $V_{\\text{top-K}}$ encompass only *ca.* two-thirds of the whole probability mass in the first step, it includes almost all of the probability mass in the second step. Nevertheless, we see that it successfully eliminates the rather weird candidates $\\text{\"not\", \"the\", \"small\", \"told\"}$ \n",
        "in the second sampling step.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's see how *Top-K* can be used in the library by setting `top_k=50`:"
